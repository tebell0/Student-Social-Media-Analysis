## Analysis of Social Media Usage Among Students
As the world continues to grow, much of human interaction is found on online social media platforms. We wanted to discover if there was a correlation between the general lives and/or academic performance of students and their social media usage. The dataset provided us with much to work with, and we provided meaningful insights on the effects of social media.

## Our Process
1. Go through the CSV file of the data to understand its contents
2. Connect this file to Tableau
3. Create LOD calculations to find specific values such as "Addiction Score per individual platform"
4. Create complimentary visualizations
5. Perform formatting and filtering for ease of understanding

## Final Result
