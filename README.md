## Analysis of Social Media Usage Among Students
As the world continues to grow, much of human interaction is found on online social media platforms. We wanted to discover if there was a correlation between the general lives and/or academic performance of students and their social media usage. The dataset provided us with much to work with, and we provided meaningful insights on the effects of social media.

## Our Process
1. Go through the CSV file of the data to understand its contents
2. Connect this file to Tableau
3. Create LOD calculations to find specific values such as "Addiction Score per individual platform"
4. Create complimentary visualizations
5. Perform formatting and filtering for ease of understanding

## Final Result

## Lessons Learned
There were a number of key takeaways from this project as it provided great insight into how the youth is making use of different social media platforms and how these platforms are contributing to our behavior on a day to day basis. From our analysis of this data, we came to the following conclusions:
- There is an inverse correlation between social media usage and mental health score
- Consequently, those who use social media more are likely to get less sleep and engage in more conflicts over time
- All academic levels are being affected by this, it is only the extent at which they are affected that changes
- Males tend to see a general increase in conflict levels in their early 20s, while females have higher initial confilct levels in their late teens but this tends to drop off as they enter their 20s.
- Males experienced conflicts more broadly across social media platforms (text and media) while females experience conflicts more consistently on media-based platforms, indicating that comparison is the likely root cause of these conflicts
- Media-based platforms such as Tiktok, Instagram and Snapchat have the highest addiciton rates
